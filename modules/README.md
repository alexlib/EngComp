# Modules

This folder contains the learning modules for the course in Engineering Computations.

**[Module 1: Get data off the ground](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp1_offtheground)**

The first three lessons are focused on creating a foundation with Python programming constructs using essentially no mathematics. The fourth lesson introduces the basic data structure in scientific computing: arrays. The final lesson is a worked example of linear regression with real data.

[**Module 2: Take off with stats**](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp2_takeoff)

These lessons explore data analysis and statistics using real data,  and data visualization. The fourth lesson takes a deeper dive into `pandas` and its powerful data structure: the data frame.

**[Module 3: Fly at change in systems](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp3_flyatchange)**

This module is a launching pad to investigate change, motion, and dynamics, using computational thinking.

**Module 4: Land on vector spaces**
(Under development)
